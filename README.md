# Player Macro Configurator

## The problem
Games go more smoothly when players have some commonly used macros on their hotbar, but actually getting the macros set up is a PITA:
* Logging in as each player and setting the same bar up many times is awful (particularly with passwords or many players)
* Asking players to set up their own macro hotbar is... no.

## The solution: Player Macro Configurator!
With PMC, just set your macro hotbar up the way you wish it was for all players. Then right-click the word "Players", click Yes, and you're done:

Boom! All your players (even offline ones) now have that sweet macro hotbar that you created for them.

## Roadmap:
1. Automatically assign characters to players if they own exactly one Actor (bonus feature!)
2. Assign the macro hotbar only to selected players
3. View and edit the macro hotbar of a particular player
4. Lock player macro hotbars
5. Saving and restoring your own macro hotbar
6. Custom hotbar compatibility (https://github.com/Norc/foundry-custom-hotbar).

## Changelog

v1.0.3 - Initial public release, inspired by The League of Extraordinary Developers July 2021 Package Jam but sadly entered too late.
