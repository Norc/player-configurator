# Player Configurator

Easily set macro hotbars and assign tokens for many players at once. Particularly useful for people who run a lot of one shots, such as Adventure League or convention GMs, and West March campaign style campaigns.

The interface of this module is directly in its Module Settings buttons for now. 

## Changelog

Initial release for The League of Extraordinary Developers July 2021 Package Jam.
